    <h1>While You’re Away</h1>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>The days move slow, love,<br>
      like clouds with no wind to guide them.<br>
      Your absence hums through my veins —<br>
      a quiet ache, a tender hush.</p>

      <p>The room is still,<br>
      yet it hums with your memory.<br>
      Your laughter clings softly<br>
      to the corners of my heart.</p>

      <p>The nights stretch endlessly —<br>
      the clock ticks slow, unkind.<br>
      I trace the places you once stood,<br>
      as if my gaze could call you back.</p>

      <p>I miss you.<br>
      The days feel hollow without your voice —<br>
      hours pass, but they don’t live.<br>
      I reach for my phone,<br>
      half expecting your name to light the screen.</p>

      <p>But only silence answers,<br>
      cold as rain on glass.<br>
      Even my laughter hides itself<br>
      when you’re away.</p>

      <p>I keep your memory close,<br>
      like a candle that refuses to go out.<br>
      Still, sometimes I wonder —<br>
      do you feel this ache too?</p>

      <p>It’s only a week, I tell myself,<br>
      but my heart doesn’t count time that way.<br>
      It counts by heartbeats,<br>
      and every one whispers your name.</p>
